###  **Motivation** 
 
[Lenskart](https://www.lenskart.com) not only serves fashion brand to customer but also power eyeglasses and contact lenses which are custom made for every 
customer. This makes it a very niche product as well as an company serving essentials commodities for it's customer. delivery and ease of ordering from online 
and offline stores is what we take very seriously. Any downtime could cost not only business but also could impact delivery of his/her eyeglasses or contact 
lenses. As an engineering team who is always accepting challenges , we started looking at chaos engineering very seriously once we also faced some major 
downtimes in our platform due to system failure or DDOS attacks. It didn't took us time to realize that just running shop on cloud was not good enough 
we have to prepared for chaos situations not just that we have to simulate it and find weak points in our architecture. So, we frist started with manual 
and scripted chaos but the problem was that they were hard to reproduce and involved a lot of effort to plan and execute them. Then we started exploring
if we could have a framework which could help us maintain our chaos experiments in form of templates. After looking at a couple of tools we narrowed down on
Litmus. 

### **How are we using Litmus**

We started using Litmus from our devops kubernetes cluster , where we first started to test stateful service like redis clsuter or elasticsearch. We then
gradually started testing our services using Litmus. We have gradually moved from our integration environments to preproduction. We are regularly maturing 
our hypostesis and writing relevant experiment for these. Currently we haven't integrated these experiments into our CI/CD pipelines but in future we have 
plan to run these experiments with every release. 

### **Benefits of using litmus**

We are quite new to Litmus framework but what we have really gaines from Litmus in templating of our chaos experiments and able to maintain them in our cvs.
This is has really helped us with the reproducibility of the experiments. It has opened new opportunities for us where we can write our own custom experiments
which might be very specific targetting to our inhouse and public services. We have started ranking the experiments and adding it to our experiments so that we 
could now measure the reasiliency of our services. This would also help us in future to be more targeted in our resiliency journey.
